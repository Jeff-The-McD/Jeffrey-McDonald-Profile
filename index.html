        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Jeffrey McDonald and I’m currently a 3rd year at Cal Poly Pomona earning my Computer Science degree. 
            My interest in Computer science had first been started in a high-school web development class focused on the front-end with HTML and CSS. 
            Using adobe dreamweaver and an old tutorial from the 2000's. 
            What that class taught me was how to break apart things in a systematic matter to be able to build it from the ground up. 
            This passion of mine was continued further when I had joined a software engineering club at Cal Poly Pomona called the “Software Engineering Association” which focused on career development, technical skills, and behavioral tips for interviews. Without this guidance I would’ve switched majors as I hadn’t done too well in my first programming class. But with the help of the people from the club I was able to finish strong and start having a direction in how to develop myself as a software engineer. 
            Now I’m aiming to further develop my skills to build in an efficient and elegant fashion though I’m still far from that.

Team environments are where I can shine so that I can take my suggestions and ideas and build off others.</p>
